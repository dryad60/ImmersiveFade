# ImmersiveFade

Automatically fades out the full interface (UIParent) after a period of no interaction for an immersive experience. Entering combat, casting a spell, using an ability/item, typing in chat, or mousing over any UI element will fade the UI back in. General movement (flying, riding a mount or taxi, or walking around) will _not_ fade the UI back in.

Full configuration of fade levels, delay times, and fade durations are available through the _Interface_ options, or through the `/ifade` or `/immersivefade` slash commands.

By default, excludes the standard minimap from fading, and opening most default Blizzard frames will prevent the UI from fading out. Other frames can be added through the _Interface_ options.
